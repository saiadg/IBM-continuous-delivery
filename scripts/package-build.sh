# In case of interperter based projects etc) must be copied over to /artifacts/binaries directory as is done below. In the existig Springboot
# application, the built Java Jar is a self-contained binary with embedded web server and hence does not need anything other than just the Jar.
# All the items placed in the /artifacts/binaries folder will be picked up by subsequent step to be uploaded either to Artifactory/IBM Cloud Object Storage
# based on your selection during toolchain creation.
